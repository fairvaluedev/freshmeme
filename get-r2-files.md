# Get R2 File Lists - Alternative Methods

Since `wrangler r2 object list` isn't working, here are alternative ways to get your file lists:

## Method 1: Cloudflare Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard**: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. **Navigate to**: R2 Object Storage → `lzmeme` bucket
3. **Browse each folder**:
   - Click `memes/` folder
   - Copy all filenames (you can select all text and copy)
   - Repeat for `assets/` and `pfps/` folders

## Method 2: Try Different Wrangler Syntax

Try these commands one by one:

```bash
# Method 2a - Basic list
wrangler r2 object list --bucket lzmeme

# Method 2b - With prefix  
wrangler r2 object list --bucket lzmeme --prefix memes/

# Method 2c - Alternative syntax
wrangler r2 bucket list-objects lzmeme --prefix memes/
```

## Method 3: Manual Test Files

For now, let's test with some common meme filenames. Add these to your lists:

### Common Meme Files (memes-list.txt):
```
boyfriend.webp
drake.webp
pikachu.webp
this-is-fine.webp
spiderman-pointing.webp
woman-yelling-cat.webp
expanding-brain.webp
change-my-mind.webp
distracted-boyfriend.webp
surprised-pikachu.webp
two-buttons.webp
```

### Assets Files (assets-list.txt):
```
lz_logo.webp
logo.png
watermark.png
```

### PFPs Files (pfps-list.txt):
```
sample.webp
avatar1.png
avatar2.png
```

## Method 4: Check R2 Public Access

Your R2 bucket might not be public. To fix:

1. **Go to**: Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → `lzmeme` bucket
2. **Click**: Settings tab
3. **Check**: "Public access" - should be enabled
4. **Custom Domain**: Should show `lzmeme.pages.dev`

## Method 5: Test CDN Access

Try opening these URLs in your browser:
- `https://lzmeme.pages.dev/memes/`
- `https://lzmeme.pages.dev/assets/`
- `https://lzmeme.pages.dev/pfps/`

If they don't work, your bucket needs to be made public.

## Quick Test

1. **Create test files**: Put these filenames in your text files
2. **Run**: `node generate-cdn-manifest.js`
3. **Test site**: See if images load (will use fallbacks if CDN fails)
4. **Fix CDN**: Make bucket public, then re-test

## Next Steps

Once you get any file list method working:
1. Update the arrays in `generate-cdn-manifest.js`
2. Run `node generate-cdn-manifest.js`  
3. Your site will load all your memes!
